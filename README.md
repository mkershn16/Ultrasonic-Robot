This is the inspiration behind our robot arm. The arm will be able to rotate at the "shoulder",                                      "elbow", and "wrist".

## Schedule
Week 1: Plan our project + github page

Week 2: Start to make a prototype for the arm in solidworks

Week 3: Assmeble the prototype in solidworks, run analysis tests to make sure the servos can support the arm

Week 4: Adjust the prototype's dimensions based on the analysis tests

Week 5: Print out the individual parts and make a basic code outline

Week 7: Assemble the parts together and finish the code

Week 8: Add wiring to the assembly and make sure the code does what we want it to do

Week 9: Adjust code if needed and make small improvements, continue to test the arm
